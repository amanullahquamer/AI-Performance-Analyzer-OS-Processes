# AI-Performance-Analyzer-OS-Processes
An interactive, realâ€‘time performance monitoring and optimization tool that uses machine learning to detect anomalies, forecast resource trends, and suggest optimizations for operating system processesâ€”delivered via a Streamlit web interface.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Realâ€‘Time Monitoring**  
  Continuously tracks CPU, memory, and I/O metrics for all running processes using `psutil`.  
- **Anomaly Detection**  
  Uses a trainedÂ LSTM model to identify unusual process behavior in system call sequences.  
- **Performance Forecasting**  
  Predicts future resource usage trends to help plan capacity.  
- **Optimization Engine**  
  Implements predictive caching, batch processing, and adaptive reordering for system calls.  
- **Interactive Dashboard**  
  Visualizes metrics and optimization steps in a userâ€‘friendly UI built with Streamlit :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.  
- **Easy Deployment**  
  Run locally or deploy to any hosting platform that supports Python and Streamlit :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
